\chapter{GPU Programming}

To achieve maximum performance, this project chooses to implement the fluid simulation software on GPUs. Originally built for graphics applications, GPUs were designed to handle a massive amount of geometries and pixels in parallel, because the computation for different objects and pixels are largely independent. The ability to do massively parallel computation motivated GPGPU (General Purpose GPU) programming models to arise, which became significantly useful for scientific computing purposes. The implementation code in this project is written using the CUDA programming model, developed by the NVIDIA Corporation.

\section{The CUDA Programming Model}
The parallel computation ability of GPUs comes from its intrinsically parallel architecture.
