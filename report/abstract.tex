Fluid simulation is an extremely common and important computational task. These simulations are often heavily expensive and require a large amount of CPU time, hence difficult to apply in real time applications. Fortunately, modern GPUs, equipped with massively parallel general purpose computing architectures, provide a solution to this problem. This project explores methods to perform fluid simulations on GPUs, and to realistically render the simulated fluids, both in real time. 


This project focuses on two of the most widely used fluid simulation algorithm: FLIP (Fluid-Implicit-Particle) and PBF (Position Based Fluids). The project studies how each algorithm can be parallelized, and creates efficient GPU implementations of these algorithms using NVIDIA's CUDA programming model. This project also extends the FLIP algorithm to support multiple fluid rendering, thereby capturing the diffusion phenomenon between different phases of fluids. Alongside the simulation, a real time liquid rendering scheme is implemented, which efficiently captures the refection and refraction effects, as well as the varying concentrations of colored fluid phases inside the liquid. These algorithms are integrated into a fully featured program, which accepts user-provided simulation parameters, then performs and renders the liquid simulation in a real time and visually plausible manner.
