Fluid simulation is an extremely common and important computational task. These simulations are often heavily expensive and require a large amount of CPU time, and are hence difficult to apply in real time applications. Fortunately, modern GPUs, equipped with massively parallel general purpose computing architectures, provide a solution to this problem. This project explores methods to perform fluid simulations on GPUs, and to realistically render the simulated fluids, both in real time. 


This project focuses on the fluid simulation algorithm known as FLIP (Fluid-Implicit-Particle), which is widely used in the computer graphics industry. The project studies how the algorithm can be parallelized, and creates an efficient GPU implementation using the CUDA programming model released by NVIDIA Cooperation. This project also extends the FLIP algorithm to support multiphase fluid simulation, thereby capturing the diffusion phenomenon between different fluids of different colours and densities. Alongside the simulation, a real time liquid rendering scheme is implemented, which includes a novel algorithm for rendering the varying concentrations of coloured fluids inside the volume of liquid. A program that integrates all of these algorithms was created, which accepts user-provided simulation parameters, and performs the simulation in real time while rendering and displaying realistic animations.
