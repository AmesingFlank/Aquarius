Fluid simulation is an extremely common and important computational task. These simulations are often heavily expensive and require a large amount of CPU time, hence difficult to apply in real time applications. Fortunately, modern GPUs, equipped with massively parallel general purpose computing architectures, provide a solution to this problem. This project explores methods to perform fluid simulations on GPUs, and to realistically render the simulated fluids, both in real time. 


This project focuses on two of the most widely used fluid simulation algorithm: FLIP (Fluid-Implicit-Particle) and PBF (Position Based Fluids). The project studies how each algorithm can be parallelized, and creates efficient GPU implementations of these algorithms using NVIDIA's CUDA programming model. This project also extends the FLIP algorithm to support multiphase fluid simulation, thereby capturing the diffusion phenomenon between different fluids of different colors and densities. Alongside the simulation, a real time liquid rendering scheme is implemented, which includes a novel algorithm for rendering the varying concentrations of colored fluids inside the volume of liquid. A program that integrates all of these algorithms was created, which accepts user-provided simulation parameters, and performs the simulation in real time while rendering and displaying realistic animations.
