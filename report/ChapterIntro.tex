\section{Motivation}
% are these words too informal?
Fluids can be seen everywhere. The smoke rising from the chimney and spreading in the wind, the milk in a cup mixing with the coffee, the calm flow of a river with tiny ripples under the rain, and the violent waves of the ocean shooting up and splashing down. Many of these these phenomenons have stunning visual effects, and quite often, realistic images of these fluids need to be computationally generated for purposes such as cinematics and video games. 


Due to the mathematical complexity underlying the motion of fluids, accurate numerical simulations often require a huge amount of computation time. However, real time computer graphics applications, such as video games, usually require the simulation to be computed in approximately the same amount of time as the physical process it represents. Moreover, in these applications, it is often needed to also realistically render and display the results of simulation (i.e, the shape and motion of the fluid) to the user. This project studies how these demands can be met on modern machines -- by utilizing the parallel computing abilities of GPUs.





\section{Related Work}



The study of the behavior of fluids dates back to 18th century, when Leonhard Euler proposed a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), known as \textit{\ref{eqn:Euler Equations}}, that governs the behavior of an idealized incompressible and inviscid fluid. In the 19th century, these equations were extended by Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes into the famous \textit{\ref{eqn:Navier-Stokes Equations}}, which describe a much wider class of fluids that occur in the real world. These equations are explained in greater details in chapter \ref{chapter physics}, and they are exactly what most fluid simulation softwares, including the one implemented in this project, are trying to solve. 

Somewhat unfortunately, the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations have extremely difficult mathematical properties, and general analytical solutions are yet to be found even today. As a result, softwares resort to numerical methods to approximate solutions. In computer graphics applications, there are two main families of numerical methods for solving the fluid equations: the grid-based methods and the particle-based methods. Each approach comes with its own benefits and drawbacks, but could both be implemented efficiently on GPUs to achieve real time simulation.

The grid-based methods relies on spatial discretizations of the scalar and vector fields that represent the fluids. The most widely used discretization method, known as the \textbf{MAC} (Marker and Cell) \textbf{grid}, was proposed by Harlow and Welch \cite{harlow1965numerical} in 1965. This scheme offers second order accuracy, and is used as a basis of most grid-based fluid simulation algorithms. 

A significantly important step during a grid-based simulation is to move all the physical quantities stored in the grid (e.g concentration) according to the velocity field. This step, known as \textit{advection}, essentially determines how the shape of the fluid evolves over time, thus is key to a high-fidelity simulation. A few popular advection algorithms include \textbf{MacCormack}\cite{selle2008unconditionally} and \textbf{BFECC}\cite{kim2005flowfixer}, both of which have efficient GPU implementations\cite{chentanez2011real}\cite{xu2011interactive}. This project chooses to implement the advection algorithm known as \textbf{FLIP} (Fluid Implicit Particle)\cite{zhu2005animating}, developed by Zhu and Bridson. This algorithm, interestingly enough, makes uses of particles to move quantities within the MAC grid. FLIP has various advantages over the purely grid-based algorithms, and is likely the most widely used advection method nowadays. 

As an addition to the traditional single phase fluid simulation, Kang et el.\cite{kang2010hybrid} showed how to extend the grid-based algorithms to capture the diffusion between multiple miscible fluid phases (e.g red ink spreading in transparent water). This project implements a modified version of the proposed algorithm, where FLIP, rather than BFECC, is used to advect the concentration of different fluid phases.



Apart from grid-based simulations, there is also a family of particle-based fluid simulation algorithms called \textbf{SPH} (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics), which does not rely on a grid. Originally developed for astronomical simulations by Lucy\cite{lucy1977numerical} and Monaghan \cite{monaghan1992smoothed} in 1977, SPH was introduced to computer graphics in 2003 by Müller\cite{muller2003particle}. The SPH method represent the fluid by a moving cloud of particles, which carry the physical quantities of the fluid with them. This project chooses to study and implement an extension of SPH, called \textbf{PBF}(Position Based Fluids), developed by Macklin and Müller\cite{macklin2013position} in 2013. This extended algorithm improve upon the plain SPH in that it enforces the incompressibility constraint of fluids, which is important for visual fidelity. 


On the rendering side, this project follows the proposal by Zhu and Bridson\cite{zhu2005animating}, who showed how a particle representation of a fluid can be used to compute a signed distance field, which represents the distance to the fluid surface of each point in the 3D space. An algorithm known as Marching Cubes, invented by Wyvill\cite{wyvill1986soft} and Lorensen\cite{lorensen1987marching}, can then use this field to reconstruct the surface of the fluid into a triangle mesh representation, which is suitable for rendering. Alternatively, screen space algorithms\cite{van2009screen} can be used, which does not generate a triangle mesh and directly uses the particles for rendering.



\section{Project Outline}


This project focuses on studying fluid simulation algorithms and their GPU parallelization. An extended version of the FLIP algorithm, which supports multiple fluid simulation and diffusions between fluids of different colors, is studied and implemented on GPU, with the details elaborated in chapter \ref{chapter grid}. Similarly, the PBF algorithm is also studied and implemented, as described in chapter \ref{chapter particle}. 

To visualize the simulations, the project implements a fast surface reconstruction algorithm, which transforms a particle cloud representation of fluids into a renderable triangle mesh. A real time renderer is implemented to render the mesh while capturing all the reflection and refraction phenomenons that occur in the real world. Furthermore, the renderer incorporates a novel algorithm that computes the different levels of attenuation of light caused by fluids of different colors, thereby also realistically rendering the liquid diffusion effects. The details of the renderer are given in chapter \ref{chapter render}.

These implementations are based from their original descriptions in the papers, but many additional considerations and optimizations were taken to enable efficient parallelization. Specifically, the project utilizes NVIDIA's general purpose GPU programming interface known as CUDA, and tailors the implementation code to exploit the full potential of CUDA GPUs. The results are showcased by a fully featured program, which allows the user to easily configure the starting state of a simulation. These include the shapes and sizes of the fluid before the simulation starts, as well as the initial color and transparency of each fluid volume. The program can then carry out the simulation and render realistic results to the user in real time.
